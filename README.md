## Terraform Provider
A **provider** in Terraform is a plugin that facilitates interaction with various APIs, including cloud providers and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platforms. Providers are defined in the Terraform configuration files, specifying which services Terraform will manage.

## Terraform Versions
Could you pin your provider versions in your configuration to maintain stability and avoid breaking changes? This ensures compatibility and reduces the risk of unexpected issues during deployment.

## Terraform Main Configuration
The `main.tf` file is your Terraform module's central configuration. It contains the primary settings and resources that define your infrastructure.

## Running Terraform Code
To deploy your infrastructure using Terraform, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Provider**
   This command downloads the necessary provider plugins specified in your configuration.

   ```shell
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Create an Execution Plan**
   The `terraform plan` command generates an execution plan, allowing you to preview the changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure.

   ```shell
   terraform plan
   ```

3. **Apply the Configuration**
   Use the `terraform apply` command to execute the changes required to achieve the desired state of your configuration.

   ```shell
   terraform apply
   ```

## Helm
**Helm** is a powerful tool for managing Kubernetes applications. It automates the creation, packaging, configuration, and deployment of applications by combining multiple configuration files into a single reusable package known as a chart.

### values.yaml
Each Helm chart includes a `values.yaml` file that defines the configuration options for the application. This file allows you to customize the deployment according to your specific requirements.

## Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC)
**Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC)** is a feature that allows you to define Jenkins configuration parameters in a human-readable YAML file. This configuration can be version-controlled and treated as source code, making it easy to manage and replicate Jenkins setups across different environments.
